  * Client of Framework:
  
    * space efficient machine over Cast ADT
    * lazy D property
    * Theorem [S(C) Correctness]
    * conjecture: threesomes are lazy D, so S(3) correct.
    * conjecture: coercion in N.F. are lazy D, so S(CNF) correct.

  * Proof of Theorem [S(C) Correctness]

    * monoid property
    * cast(T,T) = id(T) property

    * Lemma [Bisimulation between S(C) and D]
      If C is lazy D, monoid, cast(T,T) = id(T), then S(C) ~ D

    * L is lazy D monoid, and cast(T,T) = id.
    * S(L) ~ D.
    * If C1 and C2 are lazy D,
      then S(C1) ~ S(C2).
    * Theorem [S(C) Correctness] If C is lazy D, then eval_S(C) = eval_D.


* Hypercoercions are correct

  * H is lazy D.
  * eval_S(H) = eval_d   by Thm. S(C) correct
